    "description": "This 3-piece modern bedroom set for the bedroom contains a 1-bed frame with a height adjustable headboard and an industrial nightstand set of 2. The upholstered platform bed is meticulously constructed with a solid frame made from premium steel and metal. The headboard features a combination of traditional button tufts and modern rectangular contours to give this low-profile platform bed a hint of vintage appeal. Unlike many traditional beds, our upgraded wooden slats are specifically designed to pair with most mattress types. No box spring is needed. The modern nightstand set with one drawable storage drawer is perfect for tucking away your latest reads and before-bed essentials.",
