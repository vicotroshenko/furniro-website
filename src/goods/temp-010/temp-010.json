			"name": "Stacy",
			"review": "Shipped quickly and package arrived undamaged. Took me about an hour to assemble. I would suggest having help as I has trouble by myself getting the last arm side put together. It like “clips” together. It sits up a bit higher which I like. I am 5’3 and it doesn’t feel like I am getting up from the ground (if that makes sense). It is also a smaller size and fits perfect in my space. Very happy with price and product. Definitely recommend if you are looking for an inexpensive sofa.",
