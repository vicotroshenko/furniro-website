    "title": "Solid + Manufactured Wood Abstract Wall Decor",
    "description": "This wall decor makes a bold boho statement wherever you want to add some texture and depth. Both abstract and eclectic, this piece includes small orbs and longer beads that resemble feathers, all threaded along a wire in a symmetrical, tiered configuration like a necklace. It's made from solid and engineered wood in a neutral tone that matches almost any color scheme. At 18` tall and 13` across, this item isn't exceptionally large, but it's still able to turn heads whether hanging in your entryway or as part of a curated display.",
