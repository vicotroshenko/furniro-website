    "description": "At first glance, you might not even realize that Picket is a handy wall-mounted coat rack thanks to its beveled pine wood dowels and beautiful shape. It has five flip hooks, each holding up to 5 lbs., which can be flipped up when not in use, creating a seamless profile that resembles modern wall art. For additional storage try hanging two or more Pickets side by side to create an eye-catching decor piece that instantly transforms into additional storage for all your hanging needs.",
