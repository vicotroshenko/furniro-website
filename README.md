Back-end's code - https://github.com/vicotroshenko/furniro-website-backend
**Furniro shop** is a site of small furniture shop. The application was developed using the React library and TypeScript. The app was developed following a mobile-first approach. The layout is Adaptive, for tablets (980px), and wide screens (1440px). In this project, I used such technology as React-Hook-Form, Redux Toolkit, React-responsive, and Axios.

**The first request may take time**. Don't worry, it is because I'm using free deploy on reder.com. Web Services on the free instance type are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request. This can cause the first response delay.
